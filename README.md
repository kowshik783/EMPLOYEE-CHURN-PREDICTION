# EMPLOYEE-CHURN-PREDICTION
  Employee churn prediction is a machine learning model uses linear regression to predict the employees decison on leaving company.
  
# PROJECT DESCRIPTION
  By updating the entire status of each employee database, we predict his decision accordingly. So that one could predict what the employee is going to do in future. If he is going to continue his work or he demand salary increment. By using this data the Manager could decide about the employee and could properly utilize the Human Resource.
 # AZURE SERVICES USED:
   Azure machine learning studio is used to create, train and evaluate the machine learning model.
   In Azure machine learning portal, select or import a dataset for the model. 
   After uploading the dataset as CSV file, then select the blocks for the model and then connect and visualize the blocks.
   The final output will be visualized in the evaluated model.
